# TZC-200 Enhancement P2025.27.04-10

## Radio Button Relocation

### Overview
This release updates the layout of the radio buttons in the TZC-200 timezone converter. The radio buttons have been moved from their grouped position at the top to be next to their respective date/time box labels, improving the user interface and making the relationship between the radio buttons and their corresponding date/time boxes more intuitive.

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Radio Button Relocation
- **Before**: Radio buttons were grouped together at the top of the converter section
- **After**: Each radio button is now positioned next to its corresponding date/time box label
  - "Current Date/Time" radio button is next to the "Current Date/Time" label
  - "Custom Date/Time" radio button is next to the "Custom Date/Time" label

#### 2. Implementation Details
- Removed the original radio button group from the top
- Added a hidden RadioGroup to maintain the state (ensuring the radio buttons still work as a group)
- Added custom radio button elements next to each date/time box label
- Styled the radio buttons to match the design
- Added onClick handlers to update the timeMode state when the radio buttons are clicked

### Impact
- Improved user interface with clearer visual relationship between radio buttons and their corresponding date/time boxes
- Enhanced user experience by placing controls closer to the elements they affect
- No functional changes to the conversion logic or date/time handling

### Testing Scenarios Covered
- Verified radio buttons appear next to their respective date/time box labels
- Confirmed radio buttons function correctly (only one can be selected at a time)
- Tested that selecting a radio button properly activates the corresponding date/time box
- Verified that all existing functionality continues to work as expected
